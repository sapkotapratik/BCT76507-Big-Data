-- This repository mostly consist of notes on various big data technologies discussed as per the syllabus.

-- Along with that there will be practical demonstration of big data tools using Cloudera VM as in standard industry setup.

-- Additionally there will also be topics on various recent advancement to big data ecosystem and the cloud based data engineering topics also.

-- The primary focus will be to make content so student/freshers will have clear understanding of the currently industry scenario along with course syllabus.



Common FAQ's freshers/student have will starting with big data technologies:

<b> 1) Nowdays, in market there is trend of Spark why should I start with Hadoop/Mapreduce ecosystem? </b>

Ans: The short answer is yes you can direcly start with Spark. But you need to understand the basics of how distributed data processing works properly.

Having familiarity of Mapreduce concept and Hadoop ecosystem gives you that clear understanding. Spark is just one of the data transformation or processing tool

that is popular in market.


<b> 2) Which programming language should I learn for big data technology? </b> 

Ans: This is also most confusing question for student starting out in 2022. There was trend on writing MapReduce jobs on Java but that no longer useful apart 
from understanding some helloworld stuffs. Coming to 2022, Spark support Scala as there native language. But my advise will be use:

<b>  - Python and </b> 

<b>  - SQL</b> 

This will cover most of data engineering requirement. You will be using Python and SQL in various tools and scenario like Hive, Pyspark or SparkSQL.
